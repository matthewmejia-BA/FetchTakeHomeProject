### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to prioritize the UI and the logic of utlizing both the search bar and filter of cuisine types. I wanted to provide a seamless experience, allowing the user to fine tune their search. I also decided to implement a random recipe feature to help the user decided more quickly if they don't have a preference. 

Thirdly, I chose to prioritize learning to cache images using AsyncImage. I found an interesting article (https://matteomanferdini.com/swiftui-asyncimage/) that goes into depth on how AsyncImage doesn't truly cache images, even though Apple documention sort of suggests it's suppose to. 

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I worked on this project for about 10 hours. 5 hours focused, 5 hours with some distractions (work, personal life, etc.)

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I think my weakest part is Unit Testing. I don't have a ton of experience in that setting, although I am looking to dive deeper into it and gain more skills. I tried to implement a couple test cases: 1) Valid api / http response status code, and 2) Valid json data decoding.
